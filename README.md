The contact interfaces (SWD and USB) can be connected to programming interface and devices using Pogo pin connectors with the help of suitable clips as shown below in the image.


The purpose of this module is to add a 'voice recognition on edge' capability to a Smart Plug. The NINA module also provides BLE capability and makes communication and control via BLE also possible.
